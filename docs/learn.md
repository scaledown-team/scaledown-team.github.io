# Learning TinyML

TinyML combines techniques from embedded systems, IoT, software engineering and machine learning. At ScaleDown we understand that learning about these fields can be daunting. This is why we have been working on creating courses, study groups, books and other learning materials to help you learn about this field. Below are some the things we have done and are working on!

## Study Groups
We started our first study group in Feb, 2021. We wanted to teach students about TinyML by telling them about the different TinyML techniques and tools and also showing them how to use those tools to build projects. Moreover, since most new TinyML techniques are still released in the form of research papers, we also taught students how to stay updated in the field by reading and discussing research papers.

You can find all the slides and videos of the study group [here](https://github.com/scaledown-team/study-group).

## Books

[Practical TinyMLOps](https://scaledown-team.github.io/tinymlops_book/): TinyMLOps is MLOps for TinyML. Preparing models for TinyML requires extra steps which a standard MLOps pipeline does not have. Furthermore, many standard MLOps steps need to augmented with TinyML specific implementations or even removed. This is why we need TinyMLOps. In this book we talk about what TinyMLOps is, the different parts of a TinyMLOps system and how to build your own TinyMLOps system. Note that this book is currently a work in progress!
