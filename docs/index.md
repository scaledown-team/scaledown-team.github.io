# Scaledown
Scaledown is an Open-Source Neural Network Optimization Framework for TinyML Devices.

Simply put, we help you scaledown your large neural networks into small ones so that you can deploy them to resource constrained edge computing devices like Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's and Mobile Phones.

If you are wondering what TinyML or Edge Computing is, take a look at our [free book and course](https://scaledown-team.github.io/practical_tinyml_book/).
