# Introduction

The Hardware Library is a physical library present in a city near you. 

## How does it work?

The Hardware Library is like any other library, you can use the hardware and then return it. 
Anyone can use the hardware present in the list below, free of cost. Once they are done experimenting and running their first hardware library, they can return it and get another one, to experiment on.
Currently we have started our library in Singapore.

## Frequently asked Questions

1. **How do I know which Hardware to pick?**<br />
    Check out our current Hardware present, go through the specifications and decide on which one suits your project or need
2. **How do I return my hardware to the library?**<br />
    We will send a detailed instruction on how to mail back the hardware. It will be mostly through normal postage services. Alternatively, it can be left at POP Station near you and will be collected by us. 
3. **I loved the experience, how can I get more hardware?**<br />
    You can get more Hardware, by requesting for it. There is a section, where you can mention if you have borrowed hardware before. We also believe in giving the knowledge back to the community, so show us how you used the hardware and we would love to give you more! 
4. **Can I place a request for 2-3 hardware devices?**<br />
    Currently our hardware devices are limited, so we will only be providing one at a time. Not to fret, we are constantly reaching out to indivduals and organisations to help us with the supply of devices
5. **I have some extra hardware devices, how can I contribute/donate?**<br />
    Thank you so much for donating hardware to our community. Your efforts will go a long way in democratising TinyML education in the community.
