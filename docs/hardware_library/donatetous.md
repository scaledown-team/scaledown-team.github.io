## Donate Hardware

**"Did you know that Hardware Devices cost almost 2-3 times a average daily income in developing countries?"**

We are currently supporting our community by "Hardware Library" which provides indviduals with a chance to try out TinyML without the need of investing in New Hardware. You can help us by donating your hardware to the library. 

[Reach out](https://forms.gle/1DrvsjMvBJpogUBA9) to us for donating hardware! 


## Collaborate with Us

Learning and Development are present in our core model as we strive to achieve more people actively using TinyML and increase the ease of deployment.
