# Intro

This getting started guide shows you how to use most of scaledown's features.

Each page gradually introduces you to more advanced features and is divided into sections so you can use them as a reference when building your project.

If instead you are looking for a more detailed API reference, you can find it [here](api/index.md)

# Install scaledown
You can install scaledown by running
```bash
pip install scaledown
```

To get the latest version of scaledown, you can install the nightly build
```bash
pip install sd-nightly
```

Since scaledown is meant to be installed and used in edge devices, it has intentionally been made as lightweight as possible. No extra packages are included along with the package and any other framework or tool that you need to use should be installed separately.
