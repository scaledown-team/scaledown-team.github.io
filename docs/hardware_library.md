# Hardware Library

The Hardware Library is a physical library present in a city near you. 

## How does it work?

The Hardware Library is like any other library, you can use the hardware and then return it. 
Anyone can use the hardware present in the list below, free of cost. Once they are done experimenting and running their first hardware library, they can return it and get another one, to experiment on.
Currently we have started our library in Singapore.
